## Fast Forward
Fast forward merge can occur when there is a linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch.
- Create New Branch -> adds some commits -> integrate it into the main line with fast-forward merge

## 3 Way merge
- Checkout on develop branch (Child) -> make some commits -> checkout on main(Parent) branch -> make some commits -> merge in the develop (Child) branch
